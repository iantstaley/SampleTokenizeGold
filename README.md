# SampleTokenizeGold
 A sample Solidity smart contract code to tokenize gold using the Chainlink Oracle.
The smart contract is called "GoldToken" and extends the ChainlinkClient contract. The constructor function sets the initial parameters for the token, including the oracle contract address, the job ID for the API call, and the fee to be paid for the Chainlink request. The setChainlinkToken function is also called to set the address of the LINK token.
